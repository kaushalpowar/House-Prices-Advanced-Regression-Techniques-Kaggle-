# 🏠 House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques-Kaggle-
In this notebook I used House Price data from Kaggle. <br />
I permorned following tasks <br />
• EDA <br />
• Data Cleaning <br />
• Predictive Modeling <br />

**EDA** 📊<br />
In EDA I analysed Shape of data, Description and Information about data. <br />

**Data Cleaning** 🧹<br />
While cleaning the data I did following steps ⬇︎ <br />
1) Dropped dedpendent value that is 'SalePrice'. <br />
2) Combined train & test set to maintain consistency <br />
3) Dropped unwanted columns like 'Id'. <br />
4) By using a function I searched missing values. <br />
5) Handled missing values by replacing 'UNKNOWN' to categorical data & Median to Numeric data. <br />
6) Rechecked for missing values. <br />
7) Performed Encoding for Categorical Feature. <br />
8) Splitted data into Train and Test set. <br />

**Predictive Modeling** 🔧<br />
Trained model using RedgeCv and XGBoost <br />
